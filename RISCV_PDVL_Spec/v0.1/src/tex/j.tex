\chapter{``J'' Standard Extension for Dynamically Translated Languages, Version 0.0}
\label{sec:j}

This chapter is a placeholder for a future standard extension to
support dynamically translated languages.

\begin{commentary}
  Many popular languages are usually implemented via dynamic
  translation, including Java and Javascript. These languages can
  benefit from additional ISA support for dynamic checks and garbage
  collection.
