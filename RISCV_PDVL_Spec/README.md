# RISCV_PDVL_Spec v0.1

This example has an "executable spec" character. The original RISC-V specification was extended to include individual transactions similar to instructions right at the location where the instruction is specified in the document.

Grepping the PDVL code from the RISC-V specification generates PDVL code which can be compiled into synthesizable SystemVerilog code.
